# Version 0.1.2 (beta)

## Minor additions:
- RedShiftTool now inherits from PostgreSQLTool, so it gains 2 extra methods.
- In GCloudStorageTool \_\_init\_\_ (when setting by the subfolder parameter) and set_subfolder methods, now it adds a trailing slash if it's missing.

- GCloudStorageTool.set_subfolder method didn't reset the filename attribute.

## Removed features:
- Package is not compatible with Google Cloud Composer anymore.

## Other solved issues:
